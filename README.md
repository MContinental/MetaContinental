About Continental Tehnology Project
We are a systems integration company. Through the intelligent integration of existing and new technologies we are developing a 
"life freedom" product based on cryptocurrencies and blockchain that is more convenient, more private, more liberating, more useful, 
less expensive and just as secure as the lifestyle you are enjoy now.
AI-powered mega search engine, which will track the world wide web for the best options for goods and services, 
including those offered from sellers who are selling directly on our own block-based e-commerce platform.

ContinentalCard ™ allows cryptography holders to use their stored assets in their wallet for daily payments in stores and restaurants all over the world.
While multiple crypto transitions can be stored in ContinentalWallet, only CTL is available from CTLCard to create an additional layer of security.

The uniqueness of the Continental ecosystem lies in an instant block transcription in just one operation, other blockchains like Ethereum have many disadvantages, 
due to the use of the Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm the transfer of funds consists of three different transactions. Money is withdrawn from one account, 
then the network is confirmed and only then is transferred to another account. This is inconvenient and transactions are extremely slow and costly.

Continental introduces changes to a seamless SPV blockchain almost instantly without confirmation from the entire network.

Continental AI
Initially was developed as a standard QAS/Question and Answer System which showed that S.C.A 
Structural Component Analysis has much more potential than a standard QAS like Siri or Google
Finishing decrypting the code the Continental development team reconstructed the nano-molecular 
component and found that this code is successfully assimilated into similar simpler cryptographic codes and, thus, instantly, reliably and safely 
adapts to the huge ecosystem of the Continental blockchain, therewith confirming a huge breakthrough in the development of nano code inside a Continental technological prosthesis.
Many people think that AI and humans are two different paths of development, but it’s not true ... !!!
Since it is a person who will create Artificial Intelligence in the future, 
the AI system will be an integral part of the way of life and will, in fact, be a super technological prosthesis for every person. 
The daily use of this technology will increase human throughput hundreds of times and change the understanding of time for billions of people, 
AI technology will be the key to achieving incredible goals in medicine, development of economics, territoriality barrier, changes and adjustments within spatial time.

Blockchain Continental
Blockchain Continental has a fixed size of 88 GB. 
Developers and users can directly and quickly access and test ultra-fast data and asset transfers on the fastest network in the world Continental, 
making Continental blockchain the fastest, safest and most reliable blockchain in the world.

Transaction speed
Continental is a true leader: 100 000 transactions per second.
The efficiency of the Continental project includes, among other things, the speed of transactions in the system. 
That is, the number of operations performed per second.
For many people, it may be a discovery that the two leading cryptocurrencies in the market have low transaction rates. 
The Bitcoin network processes less than a hundred payments per second, and Ethereum - about 200.
Compared to leading payment systems such as VISA, MC or Swift that process more than twenty thousand operations per second, this is really very little. 
The Continental ecosystem will create huge competition for existing payment systems and blockchains, 
since it is capable of processing more than 100,000 thousand transactions per second under heavy load.

Ctl Economics
CTL is a native token for the Continental network. Members of the Continental global network use it to pay for goods, products and services around the world.

Continental Card
Pay for purchases contactlessly, quickly and securely. Choose your suitable solution with the ContinentalTM card.
Virtual and physical cards
The Continental Eco System issues a virtual card with digital payment and NFC support instantly for your 
user while he waits for the physical card with the logo to arrive by mail. 
Everything is covered with a few lines of code.

Continental Mobile as a blockchain operating system is the Leading Bridge for billions of people into the real world of cryptocurrencies.
Continental mobile is a blockchain operating system that contains a storage layer, a smart contract layer, a CTL\Defi\NFTT protocol layer and eApp 2.0 layer, 
which are described in more detail below:

MetaContinent is a worldwide Metaverse construction game that immerses millions of users to the virtual universe MetaContinent, our project
uses advanced NFT technologies on the Continental Blockchain platform to reward players for their participation in the Continental network.
Any user of the Continental eco environment has a unique opportunity to buy land as a right to own, rent, lease or exchange services with other MetaContinent users.
Continental NFT Protocol, includes land and collectibles, and therefore can be rented out to other players. 
The smart contract ensures that the borrower cannot resell or destroy the object, and guarantees that the object is returned the owner at the end of the lease.
